<h2>The Floor is Lava!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Dwarves of Muspelheim have misplaced their Generic Yellow Jewels! Run through the treacherous magma caverns to find the jewels, taking care to avoid the lava flows! </li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
It’s a game with significant heart-rate deviations. First, you plan your route with lucidity, taking into account your velocity and the period of the lava flows, then the mad dash of survival begins and the risk of a stroke increases exponentially. I expect many fatalities due to my game, so it’s good that I have a lack of compassion.</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A maze runner/ collect-a-thon sort of game, but with a TWIST!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can run right, left, up, or down using the arrow keys, and can collect the yellow jewels in the maze-like caverns. However, the cavern floor becomes a burning flow of magma periodically, so be sure you get to high ground!.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Timers, mostly. And being a serious game. </li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Periodic lava flows!
Sparkling jewels to satiate your greed!
Untold wonders of the deep!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The Dwarves of the fiery realm of Muspelheim have long prospered despite their home’s harsh heat. Trading with the neighboring Vanir of Vanaheim for necessary foodstuffs but otherwise needing nothing else from anyone, the Dwarves enjoyed a position of neutrality due to the vast wealth hidden in the caverns of Muspelheim. Fire trolls, salamanders, and the occasional son of Surt plague the realm, but on the whole it is rather cozy in the magma-heated homes and the ubiquitous dwarven taverns.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In a freak accident involving a mine-cart and a rogue cave ogre, the Generic Yellow Jewels of Az-Galad have been lost throughout the volcanic chutes! You are the unfortunate dwarf who drew the short straw, and must now navigate the treacherous magma chutes without dying a horrible, burning death in order to retrieve the Yellow Jewels and restore your mining guild’s honor.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of cerebral mind challenges and Norse-inspired motifs will like this game. The casual game audience is also a very likely audience. </li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It'd be about 40 seconds for this first level, though I intend to make more levels if Phaser will work with me.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A good strategy would be to hop from island to island, making sure to take the shortest, most efficient route possible.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the assets were made by me, using JPixel. </li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I'm not sure, really. Legend of Zelda, maybe? Any top-down sort of game with lava and dwarves, I think.
